    <p> hi there </p>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>Don't fiddle with it all day. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Use your imagination, let it go. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. We wash our brush with odorless thinner.</p>

      <p>The least little bit can do so much. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Don't fight it, use what happens.</p>

      <p>Fluff that up. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.</p>

      <p>You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. This painting comes right out of your heart. Let's do it again then, what the heck. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Let your imagination be your guide.</p>

      <p>Learn when to stop. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.</p>

      <p>If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. A happy cloud.</p>

      <p>Anyone can paint. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.</p>

      <p>Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Let your imagination be your guide. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends.</p>

      <p>A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time.</p>

      <p>The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. That's a son of a gun of a cloud.</p>

      <p>Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. All you have to learn here is how to have fun.</p>

      <p>Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Let your heart be your guide. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet.</p>

      <p>A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Let's get crazy. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important.</p>

      <p>You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. You can do anything your heart can imagine. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch.</p>

      <p>Son of a gun. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. This is unplanned it really just happens. If you hypnotize it, it will go away.</p>

      <p>Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities.</p>
